This is my original research paper from my time at San Jose State University, focusing on the **qualitative data analysis of Corporate Social responsibility (CSR) among local business owners in San Jose.**

This research, entirely self-designed and executed, provides valuable insights into the motivations behind CSR initiatives in small brick-and-mortar businesses.

The research posed the question: ****To what extent do economic, environmental, and social factors drive corporate social responsibility participation?****

To answer this question, I conducted in-person, open-ended interviews with local business owners. Using the data I collected, I applied _grounded theory analysis_ to codify and identify patterns and themes from the responses; the results were provided on a table within my paper.

My study concluded that despite the uniqueness of individual backgrounds, small business owners share common traits such as a strong sense of morality, community orientation, and a desire to convey individuality.
